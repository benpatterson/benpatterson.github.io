I have a complicated relationship with alcohol. 

Take your pick on where in my heritage it's complicated: Irish, Scottish, German. Coal miners, theatre folks, academics, those that are near and those that are far away. I don't want to get too grandiose, but I am willing to bet we can point to a very large number of ethnicities and point to some cultural aspect that centers on alcohol. You need to be able to talk about it with reverence and detail. You need to be able to sip alongside your coworkers.
