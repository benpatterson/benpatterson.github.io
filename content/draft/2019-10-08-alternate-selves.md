title: Thomas Riker and Alternate Timelines
---
I only learned this on a late night television journey with my wife (read: 8:35 p.m. with Netflix), but William Riker had an alternate self that was stuck on a station for 8 years. 
_---> Yes, I'm going to unashamedly use a TNG reference to make my point._

We've seen various flavors of the problem of an alternate reality depicted in television and film (and Shakespeare, and art galleries, and comic books, and....) In this instance we had the exact same person that manifested in two realities. One is the character most of us are familiar with, who lately has spent his time googling to make sense of modern times. I was completely unaware of a copy of him walking around, and indeed, everyone was unaware of it including our main friend Will. (Yes, his facsimile was created through a transporter beam malfunction--did you even need to ask?)

Thomas is still a lieutenant, and he has worked with the tools he has had available (not many), and has kept a base relatively operational for 8 years. He's had no contact with other beings, adrift on some planet in space, but has stuck to his duty and preserved important data for scientific research. In other words, he was assigned to legacy hardware and software, and worked in the basement. He has kept things running on old equipment, with no user interaction. This person was discovered accidentally and pulled back into the hierarchical structure.

Perhaps you see where this is going....he (Thomas) is late to meetings now, doing his best to adjust to agile software development. He is ready to smile because he likes people, but he still has career aspirations. His options are limited, because he's been in the same position for 8 years. How he makes decisions is different compared to his distinguished self, and whether or not he is allowed to shape his approach is determined by his superiors (including Will Riker). Granted, the more-seasoned version of himself tends to make smarter, thoughtful decisions, but Thomas knows that legacy software best and is not, by default, allowed to make decisions about what to do with it. 

The story unfolds from there with a near-constant power struggle between the two Rikers, and it painted for me a clear picture: titles matter.
