title: Decisionmaking vs Making Decisions
---

Recently, our engineering team faced a classic conundrum: We have a legacy cluster serving customers, whose future is going to be completely rearchitected using new technology; however, the existing cluster needed to be scaled up to support increased load. The next scale point required some level of development effort. We had several options in front of us, ranging from the duct-tape and band-aids, to fresh and snazzy new parts (according to old patterns). One option we did not clearly have was inaction. We were confronting a scale point, and needed a clear strategy.

In other words, we needed to decide.

As an engineering leader, I see two approaches to this crossroads: make the decision, or enable decisionmaking. I strive for the latter.

Perhaps in other organizations or other lives, I could have picked up the gavel and declared a specific course of action, with minimal debate. This would play out in a command & control dynamic. This can be valuable in unblocking a logjam, and can likewise provide clarity to folks implementing the solution. We could focus on solving the problem through one course of action.

However, in this case, I did my best to enable the decisionmaking. This puts me in the role of facilitator. Indeed, I walked into the conversation with opinions and thoughts about what we should do. And indeed, perhaps at the end of the meeting I would still slam down a gavel with a decision. But what's important was the decisionmaking process. We set aside 30 minutes to meet (and I try to minimize meetings as much as possible). We heard from the various perspectives and approaches from the team: from the folks that are closest to the scale points we needed to be concerned about, as well as the upcoming new architecture.
