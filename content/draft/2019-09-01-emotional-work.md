title: Emotional Work
---

I had several meetings today, which is fairly normal for a person managing people. There were intra-team meetings, a cross-team meeting, a leadership meeting, and a 1-1. Every one of those meetings involves humans, and the typical human in my industry will wake up in a dwelling that has its problems, its emotionally-loaded situations, and its moments of happiness and sadness. Those humans (in the case of today's meetings) each weathered the storm of the commute into Boston.

A typical day for me, and I suspect, most manager-folk, involves emotional work. It might be within myself, or it might be navigating loaded emotions of the folks I work with. This post covers some of these situations.

1. Someone feels he's not being heard.
1. Someone hates someone else.
1. Someone is frustrated at how things are done.
1. Someone has issues at home.
