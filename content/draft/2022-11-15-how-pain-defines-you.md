title: How Pain Defines You
---

Last November, I took my sons back home to El Paso. They are old enough now to remember things, and I felt it was important to show them my grade school. I went to a parochial school in the Lower Valley of El Paso, commuting from the East Side each day. In retrospect I don't know how my parents got us to and from school every day, because they both had jobs. It's a tricky situation my wife and I deal with on a daily basis, and I continue to be boggled at how people can do it.

The school was K-8 and my twin brother and I went there straight through. My older brother came on somewhere in the lower grades and graduated. My sister shifted to a public school for 7th and 8th grade because the public school had a music program.

Our Lady of Mount Carmel is about a mile from the US-Mexico border, and is the setting for much of my childhood. It fluctuated between one and two white families while I was there. The other family had children our age, too, and in fact there was a sibling set of twins in my grade, which was pretty cool. In 3rd grade though, one of them was struck by a drunk driver and killed instantly. The driver was never found and the family started attending a different school.

The parish itself is next to the Ysleta Mission, which is technically the 2nd-oldest mission in the United States, established in <??year??>. It does get to claim however, the title of "Oldest Continuously Running Mission" in North America because it still serves mass every week. When I was in the upper grades, as extra credit I would give tours at the mission, wearing an altar boy's outfit. (And yes, I was an altar boy at my home parish.) The mission itself was burned down by a fire in <??year??> and was subsequently rebuilt. So the structure itself is from <???year???>. 

It has seen some improvements since I graduated from school. Even during my tenure, the parish pastor had done renovations of the historic mission, in an effort to modernize it. This meant many of the original walls were put behind drywall, and carpets installed on the floor. Many years later, part of my tour was to explain how this had happened. In our visit last fall though, the Mission Trail had undergone several renovations, with a focus on restoration. So what visitors see now is closer to what the mission had looked like in the 19th century.

A number of years ago, it was important to me to take my wife on the same tour, and we drove down the trail, visiting the Socorro mission, as well as the San Elizario mission. I still think they are beautiful, and in some ways I see them as holy. I fully acknowledge there are many objections to the practice of missionaries in the New World, and understand that others may disagree with me. To me, though, I see them as safe places for Catholics. In fact, the Ysleta Mission operated as a fort on more than one occasion, and part of my tour was to point out an escape route parishioners took when under attack. 

When I took my wife on the tour, the Ysleta Mission had a sign-in book at the front, where folks could say where they came from to visit, and make any comments. There was a comment there from someone that had attended Mount Carmel. I did not recognize the name; however, they pointed out what a wonderful memory school was, and how it had been a positive experience for them. So I put my name down and explained how my memories were painful ones because of the way the other children treated me.

It was important to me to show my children where I went to school. It was classic old-man: "See, you kids got it easy. You need to understand that. No gym or field. Old textbooks. This parking lot is where we played soccer."

The boys were curious about it, and mainly quiet. I think they understood there was extra meaning loaded here. So, before we got back into the car, I knelt down and explained to them that aside from my brother I never had any friends, was spit on, sworn at, pantsed, had rocks thrown at me, and so on. I was always the last pick on the basketball court and they never threw me the ball in football where I was nicknamed "sunshine" because I was a g√ºero. But that you take those experiences and draw the value out of them, and try to learn from them and become a better person. I told them that racism is bad, and I know firsthand some of the ways it can be bad. But I also know: I had the easy version.

We got back into the car, and pulled out of the lot, turning back towards the East Side. This is where I started crying and there was an awkward hush in the car until my father put a hand on my shoulder while his other hand was on the wheel. Channeling my geekdom, I said, "This is totally like Star Trek V where Kirk says, 'I need my pain. It defines who I am.'" 

Gently, my father said, "I think it's not so much the pain, but how you respond to it."

I think of that every day.
