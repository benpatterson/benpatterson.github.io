title: Letter to My Second Grade Teacher
---

Dear Mrs. Ayoub -

My name is Ben and you might remember me from 2nd grade at Mount Carmel. Maybe it's odd to receive a letter from me, but I wanted to write you one. You disciplined and challenged me alike, and ultimately your belief in me is what mattered most.

I'm living outside of Boston now, which is a long way from the Ysleta Mission. I'm married with two sons and have a college degree. I didn't become a doctor or lawyer, didn't become famous like the nicer notes in the yearbooks tell me. But I'm earning a living, doing interesting work, and can't register too many complaints nowadays.

My wife is a teacher in a nearby school district, and my younger son just finished 2nd grade. Now that I can say both sons have cleared that grade, I'm thinking back on my time in your class. I wanted to write you to thank you.

In your class, I would shout at the top of my lungs, and I would throw jackets onto the floor. Being a scant 8 years old I had no idea how closely this was related to how I was treated by my classmates: teased, laughed at, embarrassed. Second grade was the year a kid in another class threw rocks at me, but it was before I was sworn at daily or pantsed on the basketball court. In second grade, you gave me a U in conduct. I think it was the first or second 6-week period. 

That U was shocking when I saw it. It was only then that I realized my behavior was not helping me. I had to do better. For the next 6 weeks, you would write my father a note on a weekly basis to point out how my behavior had been. I'm guessing you remember this. But perhaps most important, _I_ remember it. It was a defining time for me. You emphasized that my behavior would not be tolerated, and that was a message that I'm glad you gave me. Indeed I worked on having better behavior after that. I can't claim to be in perfect conduct all my life, and I can't claim to have avoided mistakes. But the underlying lesson---that there are ways of holding my own conduct that could be detrimental to my success---was a stabilizing lesson.

Likewise in 2nd grade, you gave me extra reading assignments because I'd shown some advanced reading skills. My older son is an avid reader, himself. He stays up late reading books sometimes (we have to give him "lights out"), and he has had teachers that disallow reading above his level. There are legitimate reasons for this of course, but I'm thankful that you thought to give me extra assignments. Not only did they challenge me, they also taught me to do work on my own even when no one else had to do it. 

I learned some programming in high school, but took no computer science courses in college. Years later as an adult riding a train on an hour-long commute, reading on my own (and having the confidence and comfort to do so) gave me the chance to learn modern programming. With that I was able to grow in my career and evolve my roles. It took me in directions that otherwise would not have been available to me.

Anyway, being married to a teacher now, I understand the stress, the workload, and the sometimes thankless aspect of the job. My time at Mount Carmel has shaped who I am (through the good and bad times). Reflecting on that time, you stick out as someone who had my best interests at heart. I want you to know that I'm thankful for that, and it has had long-lasting, positive impact on my life.

I wish you the best and God bless.

Ben Patterson
