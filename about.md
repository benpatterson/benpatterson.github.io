**Ben Patterson** is a writer, a coder, a Texan, a Massachusettsan (if you consider 20ish years enough), a Red Sox fan (if you consider a lifetime enough), a hiker, an army brat (sorta). If you know him: great! If you don't know him, he's melding his passions for coding, writing, and basically interesting-stuff here.
