**Ben Patterson** a.k.a. [@benmadrone](twitter.com/benmadrone), is a writer, a coder, a Texan, a Bostonian, a Red Sox fan, a hiker, an army brat (sorta). If you know him: great! If you don't know him, he's trying to be more explicit of the things he does at work and the things he does in his spare time.
