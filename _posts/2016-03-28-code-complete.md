title: Code Complete
---

I wanted to write about this phrase because I have some hang-ups on it. You can blame past experience if you want. But, when I hear this phrase, I'm hearing a worldview that I disagree with.

It tells me that you think you are done, and testing your code is mere overhead. Even a hassle. Let me give you translations of this phrase:

* "Tests are an inconvenient add-on to the greatness that is my code."
* "I don't actually know if my code works. While writing it, I clicked through the best-case scenario only."
* "I just put together a pile of unverified junk but we can put it in production if we need it sooner."
* "Hi. I like to build card houses. Man I'm going to be frustrated when this falls over in a few minutes."

Look, I know I'm splitting hairs, but saying "code complete" and saying "I just need to write tests" are two equal phrases, but to me they are very different. Here are my translations to "I just need to write tests":

* I have initial structure in place. It's going to change from here.
* I am now going to question what I've written, and respond to those questions.
* I'm not done yet.

"I have to write my tests" means that you know you're not done. It's basic, really. "Code complete" says that you think you're done when you're really about halfway done. But, perhaps the worst offense of all, using the word "complete" makes it sound to a product owner that you are mere minutes away from being done. That expectation will never be met, of course, because once you actually do start writing tests (or asking someone to test it for you, because I'm already wondering if that's your mentality), you're going to find bugs. At least, if you put in the effort (and you may not because you think you're done, and that notion is going to really hamper your ability here).

Please don't use that phrase. Even saying you're "done" can get tricky. But, you're not ready to ship until you're code is covered and passing.
