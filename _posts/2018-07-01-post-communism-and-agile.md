title: Post-Communism and Agile
---

My first job out of college was at a financial services firm where I started with processing paperwork for 401k plans. It was not exactly challenging on the mental psyche but it was a job and that's what I needed after college. At one point, someone in the department quizzically asked there were serial refinancers, and I decided to conjure a report that could tell us. The interface for reports was a raw COBOL text box that you could load into a thrice-hourly batch job. Indeed, with some looping and date-crawling, we found three individuals that would get their 401k contribution put into the plan, and would then refinance their loan to get this money. It was legal, but it wasn't exactly healthy practice for a plan. The rules were adjusted the next plan year. This coding quest was fueled by the combination of my Economics degree and my technical skill. (I am not claiming to be a genius in either one, but the combination, I submit, is not typical.) This combination is something that continues to inform my perspective when working in Engineering organizations. 

When thinking about adopting a large change such as adopting Agile for an organization, I think of it from the perspective of organizational behavior.

One of the more fascinating subjects I studied in college was on transition economies. At the turn of the 21st century, that generally referred to countries that were adjusting to post-communist life. It was a fascinating time in macroeconomics because entire countries were altering how they did commerce. It was the whole system, too, all the way from how to pay people based on their job or skills, up to creating industries that had previously been government-controlled or simply did not exist. It was not only changing a system, it was shifting a culture. How did economists recommend handling these transitions? There wasn't exactly a lot of historical examples to apply (though, people are smart and found some). 

There were two extreme ends of the spectrum to making the transition: do it gradually, or do a shock treatment. (Pardon the out of date term; I'm pulling from my out of date textbook.) Each approach came with pros and cons of course, but this is how I look at making changes within Engineering. In this case, I'm talking about adopting Agile (specifically, Scrum). There are two extremes, and an organization needs to decide where they land on the spectrum. 


### 1. Gradual Shift

At its most extreme, a gradual shift would be unnoticeable to the folks doing the work. The system would evolve over time to follow certain practices, with workflow changes of minute differences until one day everyone looks around and realizes that they are already executing Agile Scrum and just need to announce it. Of course, that's extreme! In reality, an organization may decide Scrum is what they want, and make small changes over time, marching towards that goal. 

On one hand, this approach is not very disruptive, kind of like sculpting with a chisel or even a toothpick. The personnel will basically get ample time to adjust to changes and arguably this means they are invested naturally with minimal distraction. In reality however, detractors that have never bought into it could bring a persistent sag to morale. In her book, _The Change Monster_, Jeanie Daniel Duck points out how critical it is to get proper buy-in, and to handle detractors aggressively. The same went for a post-communist economy: slowly auction off government assets, slowly loosen regulations on the areas the government controlled, and the economy makes adjustments, ranging from building a certain amount of widgets, to learning new skills.

For a company, when looking at a gradual model, buy-in will be much deeper in the organization's roots, and the system could easily feed itself into improvements over time. However, getting this wrong can result in problems that are just as deeply rooted, so the gradual approach needs full attention for the whole ride.

The most obvious cost to this approach is the amount of time it will take to complete. That's a central point in the decisionmaking that an organization will have to weigh. If an organization has time (or decides to take the time), it could be the right fit, giving the culture time to shift with minimal impact on the short-term. Arguably, the longer something takes to implement, the more sustained the impact will be.


### 2. Shock Treatment

This is the other extreme: yesterday you are not an Agile Scrum or SOC2 shop, today you are. That's an exaggeration of course, but essentially the approach is: swift and resounding. The benefit of this approach is its unequivocal nature: the org is adopting Agile Scrum or SOC2 without a doubt. Like a big bang software release, if this approach is taken, it'll only be successful with proper preparation. Detractors will be more obvious as well, making it clear where there is disagreement so it can be managed. With a shock approach, arguably management attention can have a shorter lifespan on this issue than in a gradual approach. (The caveat there is that there still would need to be enforcement after adoption.)

In a study of this approach in transition economies, it was found that wages were sticky once they were set. In a similar way, if tweaks need to be made after adopting the change, it will be harder to put them in place and harder to be successful at it. This is in part because there's limited feedback and fewer change agents in place, and having that kind of organizational dialogue can be stifled. This can result in confusion and inconsistent adoption of any changes. 


### My Experience

Using transition economies as a reference point for making these kinds of decisions as an organization is helpful for me, when weighing the pros and cons, and coming up with an action plan. I've experienced each of these approaches both as a leader in organizations, and as an employee. When choosing between the two approaches, the tipping point for me has more to do with the appetite for change among the employees. Working in Engineering, you see a broad spectrum of folks that are open to change and innovation, and others that fight against it. I've seen behaviors along these lines up and down the development chain, whether it is writing unit tests, or building a different feature, or adopting a new deployment model. So indeed for me, the soil I'm working with has a lot to do with my own strategy. It might be obvious, but I side more with the gradual approach; however, I've implemented shock changes that have been effective as well.
